Sample Responsive Site

This repo is to serve as a place to store sample code. The code is an example of my work and is a simple, flat design that is responsive (including IE 8).

If you came here as a prospective employer, I'd love for you to download the code, put it on your server and check it out on a number of browsers and devices to see how it looks. I really hope you like it.

Everyone else: Looking for a working example of how to make a responsive design using the Susy grid? It's a neat little grid that runs on Sass and is compatible also with Compass. There is very little markup bloat as a result of using Susy, aside from a couple classes I added for IE 8 compatibility.

Please note: I put this sample together over the past few days and will continue to add features, optimize, etc. as time goes on.
